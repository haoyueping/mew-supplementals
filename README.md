# mew-supplementals

Supplemental materials for the paper of Most-Expected-Winner.

## 1. Appendix to the MEW paper

The [supp.pdf](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mew-supplementals-45F7/supp.pdf) is the appendix that contains the additional proofs, as well as the solver for RSM voting profiles.

## 2. Experiment code

Steps to repeat all the experiments:

- Install Anaconda or Miniconda.
- `conda env create -f environment.yml` to prepare for an independent Python environment with required packages.
- Execute `run_experiments.sh`
- Each experiment has its own folder in `./experiments/real/` or `./experiments/synthetic/`. The figures in the paper are generated by the `plot.ipynb` in each experiment folder.
